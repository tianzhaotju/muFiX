def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number and returns the closest integer to it.
    If the number is equidistant from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the farthest from zero.
